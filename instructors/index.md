I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the History of the Book in the Americas at the John Carter Brown Library. I am interested in libraries, book history, and digital humanities. I study the circulation of colonial texts and vulnerable archives in the U.S. and Latin America. From 2015-2017, I managed the *Reading the First Books* project at LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections, UT Austin, and from 2017-2018 I managed the digital portal to the Archivo Histórico de la Policía Nacional de Guatemala. I earned my PhD in comparative literature from the University of Texas at Austin in 2017.

My primary areas of expertise are book history, graphic design, and curatorship. I graduated from KU Leuven with Masters degrees in History and Education, and in 2014, I completed my PhD in History at the University of Antwerp with a dissertation on the publishing strategies of the Verdussen family, printers in Antwerp from 1589 to 1689, for which I received the Menno Hertzberger Encouragement Award in 2015. In 2014, I had the honor to chair the international conference of the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing held in Antwerp.
