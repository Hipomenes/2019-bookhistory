# Students and Final Projects 

## *It Utero*
*Creator: Ashley Garcia*

	It Utero is a digital repository that archives the voices of Mexican and
	Mexican-American women who write about people’s experiences in the northern Mexican border. In this site, you will also have access to book reviews and samples of the authors’ works, and reading guides.


## Reassigning Authorship: An Updated Library Guide to the "Latorre Collection on the Kickapoo Indians of Mexico"
*Creator: Alina Scott*

	Description: This project provides an itemized outline of the contents of several boxes of the Benson Library's “Latorre Collection on the Kickapoo Indians of Mexico”. Its scope is limited to materials that would add complementary information to those interested in undertaking the repatriation of the collection. This generally includes boxes and folders that contain Indigenous cultural and scientific knowledge, correspondence related to the Kickapoo and other Indigenous groups, photographs of individuals, families, ceremonies, and cultural materials, with special attention paid to authorship and individuals mentioned.

## NAIS Digital Archive
*Creators: Nicole Larrondo, Pablo Millalén, Montserrat Madariaga-Caro, Jessica Sánchez, and Pilar Villanueva-Martínez*

	Description: We created a prototype of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Digital Archive (NAIS Digital Archive) for the University of Texas at Austin. The NAIS Digital Archive documents the social history of the program's events to bring visibility to the Indigenous community on campus. The archive’s mission is to address the impact that NAIS has on the UT campus social life, recognizing the worth of NAIS community’s presence, activities, activism, resilience and creative force inside and outside academic spaces.

## Documenting Criminalization of LGBT(Q) Individuals in Dictatorial Chile (1973-1990) 
*Creator: Kaitlin Burns*

	This project is the first step in a larger research goal which seeks to fill a void in the archive for the dictatorial period in Chile, 1973-1990. The investigation focuses on documents which prove sexual mistreatment directed toward the LGBT(Q) community of Chile, and seeks to uncover the silence that reflects these communities' social exile during the time period in question.

I am an associate professor in Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Texas at Austin. My research has focused on how indigenous people—specifically Nahuas in Mexico—have utilized the written word to shape and respond to modernity as intellectuals within and beyond their communities of origin, from the colonial period through the present day. This broad research goal encompasses three primary fields: 1) Colonial/Postcolonial Latin American Literary/Cultural Studies; 2) Critical Indigenous Studies; and 3) Ethnohistory. My current work deals with indigenous (primarily Nahua) science and technology.

# Course Description

In this interdisciplinary graduate seminar we will explore theoretical and practical issues related to the creation, access, and discovery of archives and special collections, including acquisition, description and technical specifications, community building, and post-custodial models. With emphasis on critical archival theory and state-of-the-art digital humanities approaches, this course draws from literary & cultural studies, information studies, critical indigenous studies, history, art history, and anthropology as we build a rigorous theoretical framework and engage in hands-on practice. This course will pair humanistic approaches to the (de)colonial archive with practice and theory from information science and the digital humanities. 

The first unit focuses on colonial archives and special collections, using the Benson Latin American Collection as a case study. This unit surveys the field of critical archival studies from literary studies, history, and information studies. The final assignment asks students to consider the ethical obligations of special collections with colonial holdings by proposing a response to the [Protocols for Native American Archival Materials](http://www2.nau.edu/libnap-p/protocols.html), [recently endorsed](https://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-council-endorsement-of-protocols-for-native-american-archival-materials) by the Society of American Archivists. 

The second unit focuses on human rights and social justice archives, using the Archivo Histórico de la Policía Nacional of Guatemala as a case study. This unit explores the ethical complications of working with sensitive collections, as well as the practical application of these theories to digital archvies with a human rights component. As a final assignment, students are asked to propose a humanities media project that will create supplemental materials to the AHPN website that address some of the ethical concerns addressed in the unit.

The third unit focuses on indigenous and community archives. This unit explores archival structures and activities that exist outside of or beyond academic or state institutions. The final assignment, which will be designed collectively by students, asks students to propose and enact a community-centered action responding to needs, problems, or opportunities posed by a collection or archive of their choice.
