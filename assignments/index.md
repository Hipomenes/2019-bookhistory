# Assignments

There are four major assignments for this course, described in detail below. 

In addition, you are expected to complete weekly assignments, attend class regularly, and participate in discussions and workshops. This will significantly enhance your learning but will not be policed. We place the responsibility for learning in your hands.


# Assignment 1: Rare Book Description (700-900 words)
Option 1: Imagine the JCB is trying to make its collections more accessible to blind users by creating “user guides” for working with rare books. Blind or vision-impaired users can listen to an audio guide that will narrate the various features they encounter as they work through the book. Your task is to write the script for the audio guide based on a book selected from the Primary Source List.

Option 2: Imagine the JCB is trying to sell parts of its collection, and making a catalogue of objects for sale. Your task is to write a narrative description of a book that you have chosen from the Primary Source List in a way that will convince readers to bid on the book.

Regardless of the option you choose, you must include the following:
* Title
* Bibliographic Description
* A narrative of 700-900 words that describes:
	* Binding, paper, typefaces, images
	* Title, printer, date and place of publication, front & back matter, 
	* Is this book rare? 
	* How much has a volume of this book sold for? (if possible!)
	* Marginalia & ownership marks.
	* A suggestion of 2-3 books from the collection that the patron might consult next. These books should have something material in common with the book you described, either because of where they were printed, who printed them, or how they were made.  The books you choose should not be from the list we provided.
	* In addition to describing these details, you might also address: texture, smell, affect (the emotion that the book evokes), damage, anything that is weird or unusual.

# Assignment 2: Books in Context

In this assignment, you will continue to work with the book that you described in the previous assignment.

Imagine the class is curating a digital exhibit, and you have been asked to produce a blog post that will help visitors to the exhibit learn more about the context in which this object was created. Your audience is prospective Brown undergraduates and their families, so nobody is an expert in book history or American history. You should discuss the following:
* What is the historical context of the place where it was made: what was happening in history in that time and place? 
* Where does this fit in the history of the book? What was happening in general in print/manuscript/map culture, and how does this volume fit into it? Include information about who made your object and what other kinds of documents were being made at the time/place.
* How would this book have been used? Who would have been reading or using this object? Why? What for?
* At the end, name 1-2 books from the JCB that an interested person might want to look at next, and explain (in 1-2 sentences) why these books share a historical context with yours. The books you choose should not be from the list we provided.
Much like the first assignment, you are not required to make an argument in this post. Instead, you are synthesizing information from secondary sources to explain the context of the book.  Your post should have short paragraphs, subheadings, a bibliography, and some recommendations for further reading. Note that you do not need to read everything you include in this list.

# Assignment 3: Printed Broadside 

As a class, we’ll be setting type and printing a broadside. For this assignment, you are responsible for choosing one line of type from the book that you’ve been assigned. You’ll need to go to the Book Arts Studio at the Hay to set the type on your own, and then we’ll be visiting and printing the broadside together in class.

# Assignment 4: Curated Exhibition

As a class, you will be designing a curated exhibit to be displayed at the JCB at the end of the semester. The topic of the curated exhibit is: “Recovering Silenced Voices.” Working in teams of four, you’ll develop small exhibits on different themes that bring together the documents in your collection and respond to the bigger topic. Together, you will be responsible for the following tasks:

* Identifying a theme that unites the documents in your collection.
* Deciding on a narrative for the books in your subset of the collection: what story do you want to tell about the history of the book?
* Selecting the order of the books and the features of each book that you want to display. Remember that visitors might move sequentially through the exhibit, or randomly enter in the middle.
* Writing the exhibit labels: 1-2 paragraphs for each book that describes the context and the reason it has been put on display
* Writing a curator’s note for your collection: 1-2 pages total that provides background information for your part of the exhibit and explains how it fits into the broader theme.
* Writing a reflection: each person (individually) should submit a 250-350 word reflection on their experience developing the exhibit, in which you describe three challenges and name three takeaways.
